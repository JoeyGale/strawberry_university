    Strawberry University was founded in 1906 in Peach Jam, Colorado. The founder, Robert Rose, built every building on this great university with his bare hands, eating only strawberries on his break for lunch. His great grandchildren, Ahmed Musa &amp; Joey Gale, had the same passion for higher education and have continued to build this prestigious school with more buildings and also things such as expand it's online presence, and thanks to them you are on this fantastic website.
