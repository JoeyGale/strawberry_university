    Strawberry University is ranked #2 in the world for it's student life by ThisIsAMadeUpWebsiteCalledStudentLife.org based on its diverse range <br/>
    of different activities available for all students to do 24/7. All dorms for students are former luxury apartments with more room <br/>
    than most know what to do with. All meals served at Strawberry University are prepared by the world's top chefs <br/>
    at no extra cost to the students. There are hundreds of clubs you can join and if none fit your needs, <br/>
    it is very easy to start your own, all you need is an idea and a couple people who would like to be apart of it. <br/>
