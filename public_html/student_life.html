    Strawberry University is ranked #2 in the world for it's student life by ThisIsAMadeUpWebsiteCalledStudentLife.org based on its diverse range <br/>
    of different activities available for all students to do 24/7. All dorms for students are former luxury apartments with more room <br/>
    than most know what to do with. All meals served at Strawberry University are prepared by the world's top chefs <br/>
    at no extra cost to the students. There are hundreds of clubs you can join and if none fit your needs, <br/>
    it is very easy to start your own, all you need is an idea and a couple people who would like to be a part of it. <br/>

 <p>Student Life is currently looking for new ambassadors! We would love to have creative and innovative students join our team!</p>
 <p>The ambassadors of Student Life would like your feedback on our latest activities. How do you think they went? Were the activities well run? Did     you have fun? Would you participate again? If you would like to give feedback please visit the Student Life twitter page.</p>
