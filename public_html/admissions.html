<p>
    Whether you are a first year, transfer, or international student, Strawberry University is excited you're <br/>
    thinking of joining this great school. Everything about this school is designed specifically to not only <br/>
    make this the best time of your life, but properly prepare you for life after college, which is one reason <br/>
    why we have a 100% job or graduate school placement rating within the first 3 months of graduation. <br/>
    We are thrilled to make this transition in your life as least difficult as possible and can't wait to see you on campus. <br/>
    If you have any questions or concerns, the admissions office would be excited to take your call at 555-555-5555 between the <br/>
    hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. or you can stop by our office in the middle of campus between 6 a.m. to 5 p.m.
