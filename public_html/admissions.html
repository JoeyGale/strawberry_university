    thinking of joining this great school. Everything about this school is designed specifically to not only <br/>
    make this the best time of your life, but properly prepare you for life after college, which is one reason <br/>
    why we have a 100% job or graduate school placement rating within the first 3 months of graduation. <br/>
    We are thrilled to make this transition in your life as least difficult as possible and can't wait to see you on campus. <br/>
